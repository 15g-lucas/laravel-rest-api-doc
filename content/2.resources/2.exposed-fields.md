# Exposed fields

## Define exposed fields

Each Rest resource contains a exposedFields method. This method returns an array of string specifying the columns you want to expose. This fields are accessible in term of selecting and mutating.

To add a field to a resource, you may simply add it to the resource's exposedFields method. 

```php
public function exposedFields(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
{
    return [
        'id',
        'name',
    ];
}
```

## Conditional field exposing

You might want to choose the fields you are exposing depending on the user, you can achieve this by conditioning the `exposedFields` method:

```php
public function exposedFields(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
{
    $exposedFields = [
        'id',
        'name'
    ];

    if ($request->user()->isAdministrator()) {
        array_push($exposedFields, 'password');
    }

    return $exposedFields;
}
```
