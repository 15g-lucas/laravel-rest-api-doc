# Detail

Detail is a way to get all information needed to perform actions on a resource. It will give you the current state of the resource depending of the user.

## How to use it

When you are ready to get the detail, you can use the `detail` method by making a GET call:

```json
// (GET) api/users
```

## Response

As a response, you'll receive the resource detail:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "actions": [
      {
        "name": "Send Welcome Notification",
        "uriKey": "send-welcome-notification",
        "fields": {
          "delay": [
            "required",
            "numeric"
          ]
        },
        "meta": {
          "color": "#FFFFFF"
        }
      }
    ],
    "instructions": [
      {
        "name": "Odd Even Id",
        "uriKey": "odd-even-id",
        "fields": {
          "type": [
            "in:odd,even"
          ]
        },
        "meta": {
          "color": "#FFFFFF"
        }
      }
    ],
    "fields": [
      "id",
      "name"
    ],
    "limits": [
      1,
      10,
      25,
      50
    ],
    "scopes": [
      "withTrashed"
    ],
    "relations": [
      {
        "resources": [
          "App\\Rest\\Resources\\UserResource"
        ],
        "relation": "posts",
        "constraints": {
          "requiredOnCreation": false
        },
        "name": "HasMany"
      }
    ],
    "rules": {
      "all": {"id":  ["numeric"]},
      "create": {"password":  ["required"]},
      "update": {"password":  ["prohibited"]}
    }
  }
}
```

Keep in mind that this detail is really helpful because in some way, some data won't be exposed such as fields / actions / instructions depending on the user's rights and backend configuration.

`uriKey` is the data to specify when making operations. It's a unique identifier as format string also known as slug.
