# Actions

Actions is a way to provide actions for your users with a full integration in Laravel Rest Api, it includes the strong search feature to enable security and power.

Here is a look on how to use these actions:

## How to use it

When you are ready to perform an action, you can use the `operate` method by making a POST call:

```json
// (POST) api/users/actions/send-welcome-notification
{
    "fields": [
      { "name": "expires_at", "value": "2023-04-29" }
    ]
}
```

You may specify the fields provided by the user using the `fields` argument. You can have full access to the fields and validation in the [resource detail](/endpoints/detail).

`send-welcome-notification` is the uriKey of the action provided in the [resource detail](/endpoints/detail).

As a response, you'll receive the number of models you have impacted:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "impacted": 150
  }
}
```

### Complex filtering

In most cases you'll want to specify which models will be impacted by the action dynamically. The action endpoint provide full support of the search operation.
If you are not familiar with the search method, have a quick look at [the documentation](/endpoints/search).

Specify your arguments in the `search` argument:

```json
// (POST) api/users/actions/send-welcome-notification
{
    "fields": [
      { "name": "expires_at", "value": "2023-04-29" }
    ],
    "search": {
        "filters": [
            { "field": "has_received_welcome_notification", "value": false }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Response

As a response you'll receive the number of models you have impacted.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "impacted": 2
  }
}
```
