# Actions

## Introduction

Actions is a way to provide actions for your users with a full integration in Laravel Rest Api, it includes the strong search feature to enable security and power.

Here is a look on how to use these actions:

## Listing

To get a list of all resource's actions based on the current user, you can make a GET call to the action endpoint:

```php
// (GET) api/users/actions
```

You'll receive a list of all the available actions:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Send Welcome Notification",
      "uriKey": "send-welcome-notification",
      "fields": { "expires_at": ["required", "date"] }
    }
  ]
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
The `uriKey` will be the identifier you'll have to provide to authenticate the action
::

## Operate

When you are ready to perform an action, you can use the `operate` method by making a POST call:

```json
// (POST) api/users/actions/send-welcome-notification
{
    "fields": {
        "expires_at": "2023-04-29"
    }
}
```

You may specify the fields provided by the user using the `fields` argument.

`send-welcome-notification` is the uriKey of the action provided by action listing.

As a response, you'll receive the number of models you have impacted:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "impacted": 150
  }
}
```

### Complex filtering

In most cases you'll want to specify which models will be impacted by the action dynamically. The action endpoint provide full support of the search operation.
If you are not familiar with the search method, have a quick look at [the documentation]('/endpoints/search').

Specify your arguments in the `search` argument:

```json
// (POST) api/users/actions/send-welcome-notification
{
    "fields": {
        "expires_at": "2023-04-29"
    },
    "search": {
        "filters": [
            { "field": "has_received_welcome_notification", "value": false }
        ]
    }
}
```
