# Responses

## Introduction

The response is the way you have to manipulate the response given by the API for each model.

::alert{type="danger"}
:icon{name="ant-design:alert-outlined" size=25}&nbsp;
Response is the last piece of the API, use it with care since it usurpe all Laravel Rest Api logic.

## Defining Responses

By default, Rest responses are stored in the app/Rest/Responses directory of your application. You may generate a new response using the rest:response Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan rest:response UserResponse
```

You are now free to modify the `map` method from your new Response:

```php
/**
 * This map on each model returned by the API, use it at your ease.
 *
 * @var \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model $model
 * @var array $responseModel
 *
 * @return array
 */
protected function map(\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model $model, array $responseModel) : array {
    return $responseModel;
}
```

The `$model` is the initial model where has `$responseModel` is the response that would be originally initiated by Laravel Rest Api.

::alert{type="info"}
Responses are the last option you have to take advantage of the Api. In most cases you don't need this.

## Registering Responses

You now have to specify the Response in the associated `Resource` file.
```php [UserResource.php]
/**
 * The reponse the entry corresponds to.
 *
 * @var class-string<Response>
 */
public static $response = App\Rest\Responses\UserResponse::class;
```
