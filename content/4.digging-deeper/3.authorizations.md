# Authorizations

Laravel Rest Api exposes a lot of informations and it is crucial for your applications to secure who has access to which resources. Thankfully, Laravel Rest Api integrates fully with Laravel to provide ease with securing your API.

## Policies

To limit which users may view, create, update, or delete resources, Laravel Rest Api leverages Laravel's [authorization policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies).
Basically, if your model is linked to a Policy in your `AppServiceProvider`, Laravel Rest Api will use it without any more configuration needed.

This concerns the following methods:
- viewAny
- view
- create
- update
- replicate
- delete
- restore
- forceDelete

For example, to determine which users are allowed to view a User model, you simply need to define an update method on the model's corresponding policy class:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Policies;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Auth\Access\HandlesAuthorization;

class UserPolicy
{
    use HandlesAuthorization;

    /**
     * Determine whether the user can view the user.
     *
     * @param  \App\Models\User  $user
     * @param  \App\Models\User  $model
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function view(User $user, User $model)
    {
        return $user->is($model);
    }
}
```

### Disable Authorizations

Authorizations are enabled by default but you can disable these in certain situations.

::alert{type="info"}
When you are mutating / searching distant relations, this will apply the relation resource state.

### Globally


In your `config/rest.php` file, you can specify directly to disable this feature:

```php
[
    // ...
    'authorizations' => [
        'enabled' => false, // Switch this to false
    ]
    // ...
]
```

### Resource

If you want to disable this feature for certain resources only, you can use the `DisableAuthorizations` trait on your resource file:

```php[UserResource.php]
class UserResource extends Resource
{
    use \Lomkit\Rest\Concerns\Resource\DisableAuthorizations;
    
    // ...
}
```
