# Authorizations

Laravel Rest Api exposes a lot of information and it is crucial for your applications to secure the access to resources. Thankfully, Laravel Rest Api seamlessly integrates with Laravel, ensuring a straightforward approach to securing your API.

## Policies

To restrict access to viewing, creating, updating, or deleting resources, Laravel Rest Api leverages Laravel's [authorization policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies).
Basically, if your model is associated with a policy in your `AppServiceProvider`, Laravel Rest API will automatically use it, requiring no further configuration.

This concerns the following methods:
- viewAny
- view
- create
- update
- replicate
- delete
- restore
- forceDelete

For example, to determine which users are allowed to view a User model, you simply need to define a `view` method on the model's corresponding policy class:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Policies;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Auth\Access\HandlesAuthorization;

class UserPolicy
{
    use HandlesAuthorization;

    /**
     * Determine whether the user can view the user.
     *
     * @param  \App\Models\User  $user
     * @param  \App\Models\User  $model
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function view(User $user, User $model)
    {
        return $user->is($model);
    }
}
```

### Disable Authorizations

By default, authorizations are enabled but you can disable them in certain situations.

::alert{type="info"}
When you are mutating / searching distant relations, this will apply the relation resource state.

### Globally


In your `config/rest.php` file, you can directly specify to disable this feature:

```php
[
    // ...
    'authorizations' => [
        'enabled' => false, // Switch this to false
    ]
    // ...
]
```

### Resource

If you want to disable this feature for certain resources only, you can use the `DisableAuthorizations` trait on your resource file:

```php[UserResource.php]
class UserResource extends Resource
{
    use \Lomkit\Rest\Concerns\Resource\DisableAuthorizations;
    
    // ...
}
```
