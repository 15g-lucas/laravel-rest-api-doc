# Automatic Gates

## Introduction

If you are not familiar with what a "Gate" is, please have a look at the [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization).

Laravel Rest Api takes advantage of this feature to provide your frontend users direct access to the current authenticated user rights.

## Using automatic gates

Automatic gates are enabled by default. If you don't want to use this feature you have two ways to disable it:

### Globally

In your `config/rest.php` file, you can directly specify to disable this feature:

```php
[
    // ...
    'automatic_gates' => [
        'enabled' => false, // Switch this to false
    ]
    // ...
]
```

### Resource

If you want to disable this feature for certain resources only, you can use the `DisableAutomaticGates` trait on your resource file:

```php[UserResource.php]
class UserResource extends Resource
{
    use \Lomkit\Rest\Concerns\Resource\DisableAutomaticGates;
    
    // ...
}
```
