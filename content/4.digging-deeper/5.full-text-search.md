# Full text search

Laravel Rest Api fully integrates with Laravel Scout, discover how you can implement this in a few steps.

Be sure you have installed Laravel Scout before going further: https://laravel.com/docs/scout
::

To be more specific about how it works, Laravel Rest Api will implement a Scout Builder and apply to it the `filters`, `sorts` and `instructions`. After this, it will pass other parameters to the query callback of the Laravel Scout Builder. This allows you to eager load data / aggregates for example.

Be aware that using full text search disable features listed [here](/endpoints/search#text)

## Model

Full text search is only implemented on models that are `Searchable` as given in the Laravel Scout documentation:

```php
<?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Laravel\Scout\Searchable;
 
class Post extends Model
{
    use Searchable;
}
```

## Resource

### Query

Because the builder isn't the same than the search query, you should implement the `searchScoutQuery` to filter the data you want the user has access to:

```php[UserResource.php]
/**
 * Build a "search" scout query for fetching resource.
 *
 * @param \Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request
 * @param \Laravel\Scout\Builder                 $query
 *
 * @return \Laravel\Scout\Builder
 */
public function searchScoutQuery(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request, \Laravel\Scout\Builder $query)
    return $query;
}
```

### Fields

Also since you are able to totally change the fields or even create new one with scout. Laravel Rest Api defines a `scoutFields` methods which is use to validate front-end field for full-text search.

This fields will be used to validate sorts and filters fields.

```php[UserResource.php]
/**
 * The scout fields that could be provided.
 *
 * @param RestRequest $request
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function scoutFields(RestRequest $request): array
{
    return ['id'];
}
```

### Instructions

In order to give you full control over the scout exposed instructions since the handle is not the same method, you have a new `scoutInstructions` method in your resource:

```php[UserResource.php]
/**
 * The scout fields that could be provided.
 *
 * @param RestRequest $request
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function scoutInstructions(RestRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        NumberedInstruction::make()
    ];
}
```

## Instructions

For instruction since the queries are not the same you might want to customize the scout part for instructions:

```php[MyInstruction.php]
/**
 * Perform the instruction on the scout query.
 *
 * @param array                  $fields
 * @param \Laravel\Scout\Builder $query
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function handleScout(array $fields, \Laravel\Scout\Builder $query)
{
    // do something ...
}
```
