# Actions

Actions are a way to provide actions for your users with a full integration in Laravel Rest Api, it includes the strong search feature to enable security and power.

Your resource automatically exposes the actions you have defined on it. Configure it, register it and you are done !

## Overview

Actions can be generated using the `rest:action` Artisan command. All actions are places by default in your `App\Rest\Actions` directory.

```bash
php artisan rest:action SendWelcomeNotificationAction
```

You are now ready to configure your action:

```php
namespace App\Rest\Actions;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Lomkit\Rest\Actions\Action;
use Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest;

class SendWelcomeNotificationAction extends Action
{
    /**
     * Perform the action on the given models.
     *
     * @param  array  $fields
     * @param  \Illuminate\Support\Collection  $models
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle(array $fields, \Illuminate\Support\Collection $models)
    {
        foreach ($models as $model) {
            $model->notify(new \App\Notifications\SendWelcomeNotification($fields['expires_at']))
                ->delay($this->resource instanceof \App\Rest\UserResource ? 50 : 0);
        }
    }

    /**
     * The action fields.
     *
     * @param  \Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
    {
        return [
            'expires_at' => [
                'required', 'date'
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

In the `handle` method you receive a Collection of models, the models corresponds to the resource the action has been registered on.
You are free to do whatever you want in this handle method: update records, send jobs, ...

You can access the resource that launched the action using `$this->resource` at any moment.

## Register an action

To register an action, you simply need to specify it in your resource:

```php
use App\Rest\Actions\SendWelcomeNotificationAction;

class UserResource extends Resource
{
    /**
     * The actions that should be linked
     * @param RestRequest $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function actions(RestRequest $request): array {
        return [
            SendWelcomeNotificationAction::make()
        ];
    }
}
```

### Authorizations

In case you don't want to expose your actions to all users, you simply need to condition this method:

```php
use App\Rest\Actions\SendWelcomeNotificationAction;

class UserResource extends Resource
{
    /**
     * The actions that should be linked
     * @param RestRequest $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function actions(RestRequest $request): array {
        $actions = [];
        
        if ($request->user()->isAdministrator()) {
            array_push($actions, SendWelcomeNotificationAction::make())
        }
    
        return $actions;
    }
}
```

## Fields

Sometimes, you want to collect data directly from your frontend users this is what fields are made for. You first need to define them in your action:

```php
namespace App\Rest\Actions;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Lomkit\Rest\Actions\Action;
use Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest;

class SendWelcomeNotificationAction extends Action
{
     /**
     * The ation fields.
     *
     * @param  \Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
    {
        return [
            'expires_at' => [
                'required', 'date'
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

In the array returned, the key must be the name of the field given in the call. The value is the list of validation you want to provide for the field.
Laravel Rest Api automatically validates all fields using your validation rules.

You get those fields in the `$field` variable in your `handle` method.

## Meta

Because your actions are exposed to the frontend users, they do get some informations about it such as `uriKey`, `name` and `fields` but you are also free to provide your own data.

This could be done by calling the `withMeta` in your action's constructor:

```php
class SendWelcomeNotificationAction extends Action
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->withMeta([
            'color' => '#FFFFFF'
        ]);
    }
}
```

Or, you can call it when registering the action if you want to specify different meta depending on the resource:

```php
use App\Rest\Actions\SendWelcomeNotificationAction;

class UserResource extends Resource
{
    /**
     * The actions that should be linked
     * @param RestRequest $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function actions(RestRequest $request): array {
        return [
            SendWelcomeNotificationAction::make()
                ->withMeta(['color' => '#FFFFFF'])
        ];
    }
}
```

## Queued actions

If your actions need much time to operate, you might want to queue your actions. To instruct Laravel Rest Api to queue your action at runtime, you should use the `ShouldQueue` interface:

```php
namespace App\Rest\Actions;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Lomkit\Rest\Actions\Action;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest;

class SendWelcomeNotificationAction extends Action implements ShouldQueue
{
    // ...
}
```

Laravel Rest Api will chunk your results and create a job for each chunk. By default, the chunk size is set to `100`,
 if you wish to change this, declare the `chunkCount property on your model:

```php
namespace App\Rest\Actions;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Lomkit\Rest\Actions\Action;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest;

class SendWelcomeNotificationAction extends Action implements ShouldQueue
{
    /**
     * The number of models that should be included in each chunk.
     *
     * @var int
     */
    public $chunkCount = 100;
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
Chunking is also done when you are not using queue, the `handle` method will be called directly for each chunk.
::

### Customising the queue and connection

You may customize the queue connection and queue name that the action is queued on by setting the $connection and $queue properties on your class:

```php

namespace App\Rest\Actions;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use Lomkit\Rest\Actions\Action;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest;

class SendWelcomeNotificationAction extends Action implements ShouldQueue
{
    /**
     * The name of the connection the job should be sent to.
     *
     * @var string|null
     */
    public $connection;

    /**
     * The name of the queue the job should be sent to.
     *
     * @var string|null
     */
    public $queue;
}
```

### Batchable Actions

You may instruct Laravel Rest Api that an action is batchable using the `BatchableAction` and `ShouldQueue` interfaces on your class:

```php
namespace App\Rest\Actions;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Lomkit\Rest\Actions\Action;
use Lomkit\Rest\Contracts\BatchableAction;

class SendWelcomeNotificationAction extends Action implements ShouldQueue, BatchableAction
{
     /**
     * Register callbacks on the pending batch.
     *
     * @param  array  $fields
     * @param  \Illuminate\Bus\PendingBatch  $batch
     * @return void
     */
    public function withBatch(array $fields, PendingBatch $batch)
    {
        $batch->then(function (Batch $batch) {
            // ...
        })->catch(function (Batch $batch, Throwable $e) {
            // ...
        })->finally(function (Batch $batch) {
            // ...
        });
    }
}
```

The new `withBatch` method allows you to register callbacks on your pending batch. This means that these callbacks will be called depending on the batch status.

If you wish for example to send a notification if the jobs completed successfully, you should use the `then` method. This method will trigger once at the end of all jobs triggered depending on your chunk size.

If you are not familiar with batches please see the [Laravel Documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-batching)
