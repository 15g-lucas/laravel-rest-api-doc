The response is the final piece of the API and should be used judiciously, as it can override all the underlying logic of Laravel Rest API.
::

## Defining Responses

By default, Rest responses are stored in the app/Rest/Responses directory of your application. You may generate a new Response by using the `rest:response` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan rest:response UserResponse
```

You are now free to modify the `map` method from your new Response:

```php
/**
 * This maps on each model returned by the API, use it at your ease.
 *
 * @var \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model $model
 * @var array $responseModel
 *
 * @return array
 */
protected function map(\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model $model, array $responseModel) : array {
    return $responseModel;
}
```

The `$model` represents the original model, whereas `$responseModel` is the response that would typically be initiated by Laravel Rest Api.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb" color="blue"}
Responses should be considered as a final resort for leveraging the API. In most cases, they may not be necessary.
::

## Registering Responses

You now have to specify the Response within the corresponding `Resource` file.
```php [UserResource.php]
/**
 * The reponse the entry corresponds to.
 *
 * @var class-string<Response>
 */
public static $response = App\Rest\Responses\UserResponse::class;
```
