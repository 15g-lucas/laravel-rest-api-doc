# Validations

You might want to validate the incoming requests to avoid inconstancy in your database.
Keep in mind that if you want your API to provide the best user experience to your consumers you always want to have 0 direct database error. For example if one of your field is not nullable you'll want to make it required in these rules.
You can specify all [Laravel rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules) you want.

## Rules

### Create rules

You may use the `createRules` method from your resource to specify the creating rules.

```php [UserResource.php]
public function createRules(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request) {
    return [
        'required'
    ];
}
```

### Update rules

You may use the `updateRules` method from your resource to specify the creating rules.

```php [UserResource.php]
public function updateRules(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request) {
    return [
        'required'
    ];
}
```
