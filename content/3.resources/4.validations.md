# Validations

You might want to validate the incoming requests to avoid inconstancies in your database.
Keep in mind that if you want your API to provide the best user experience to your consumers you always want to have 0 direct database errors. For example, if one of your fields is not nullable, you'll want to make it required in these rules.
You can specify all [Laravel rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules) you want.

## Rules

You may use the `rules` method from your resource to specify the rules for your attributes.

```php [UserResource.php]
public function rules(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request) {
    return [
        'name' => 'required'
    ];
}
```

### Create rules

You may use the `createRules` method from your resource to specify the creating rules.

```php [UserResource.php]
public function createRules(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request) {
    return [
        'name' => 'required'
    ];
}
```

### Update rules

You may use the `updateRules` method from your resource to specify the updating rules.

```php [UserResource.php]
public function updateRules(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request) {
    return [
        'name' => 'required'
    ];
}
```

### Relation pivot rules

In some particular cases, you might want to validate the pivot fields provided by the incoming request. You can achieve this with the `withPivotRules` method when declaring your relationship:

```php
use Lomkit\Rest\Relations\BelongsToMany;

BelongsToMany::make('roles', RoleResource::class)
    ->withPivotFields(['created_at'])
    ->withPivotRules([
        'created_at' => ['required', 'date']
    ]),
```
