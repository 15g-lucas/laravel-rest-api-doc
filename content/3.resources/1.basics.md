# Basics

## Introduction

The primary feature of Laravel Rest Api is the ability to access and administrate your database records using Eloquent. Laravel Rest Api accomplishes this by allowing you to define a Rest "resource" that corresponds to each Eloquent model in your application. 

## Defining Resources

By default, Rest resources are stored in the app/Rest/Resources directory of your application. You may generate a new resource using the rest:resource Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan rest:resource User
```
You might now define the model property. This property tells Laravel Rest Api which Eloquent model the resource corresponds to:

```bash
public static $model = 'App\Models\User';
```

Freshly created Rest resources only contain an ID exposed field. Don't worry, we'll add more fields to our resource soon.

## Registering Resources

By default, all resource are not automatically registered to let you take advantage of the logic.

Since the basic usage for these will be on api side, you can declare your routes in your `api.php` file:
```php [api.php]
Rest::resource('users', \App\Rest\Resources\UsersController::class)
```

Once your resources are registered, you can verify that using `php artisan route:list`:

```
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+  
| Method    | URI                                             | Name                                   |  
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+  
| POST      | api/users/search                                | api.users.search                       |  
| POST      | api/users                                       | api.users.store                        |  
| POST      | api/users/mutate                                | api.users.update                       |  
| DELETE    | api/users                                       | api.users.destroy                      |  
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
```

## Soft Deletes

If you want to expose soft delete routes for one of your resource, you can achieve so by using the `withSoftDeletes' method while registering the resource:
```php [api.php]
Rest::resource('users', \App\Rest\Resources\UsersController::class)->withSoftDeletes()
```

You now have two more routes registered:
```
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+  
| Method    | URI                                             | Name                                   |  
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+  
| POST      | api/users/restore                               | api.users.restore                      |  
| DELETE    | api/users/force                                 | api.users.force                        |  
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
```

If you don't want to expose all soft deletes routes you can specify so:
```php [api.php]
Rest::resource('users', \App\Rest\Resources\UsersController::class)->withSoftDeletes(['forceDelete', 'restore'])
```
