# Exposed Datas

## Exposed fields

Each Rest resource contains an `exposedFields` method. This method returns an array of string specifying the columns you want to expose. This fields are accessible in term of selecting and mutating.

To add a field to a resource, you may simply add it to the resource's exposedFields method. 

```php
public function exposedFields(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
{
    return [
        'id',
        'name',
    ];
}
```

### Conditional field exposing

You might want to choose the fields you are exposing depending on the user, you can achieve this by conditioning the `exposedFields` method:

```php
public function exposedFields(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
{
    $exposedFields = [
        'id',
        'name'
    ];

    if ($request->user()->isAdministrator()) {
        array_push($exposedFields, 'password');
    }

    return $exposedFields;
}
```

## Exposed Scopes

Each Rest resource contains an `exposedScopes` method. This method returns an array of string specifying the scopes you want to expose.

To add a scope to a resource, you may simply add it to the resource's exposedScopes method.

```php
    public function exposedScopes(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
    {
        return [
            'withTrashed'
        ];
    }
```

### Conditional scope exposing

You might want to choose the scopes you are exposing depending on the user, you can achieve this by conditioning the `exposedScopes` method:

```php
public function exposedScopes(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
{
    $exposedScopes = [
        'withTrashed'
    ];

    if ($request->user()->isAdministrator()) {
        array_push($exposedScopes, 'numbered');
    }

    return $exposedScopes;
}
```

## Exposed Limits

Each Rest resource contains an `exposedLimits` method. This method returns an array of number specifying the limits you want to allow.

To add a limit to a resource, you may simply add it to the resource's exposedScopes method.

```php
    public function exposedLimits(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request) {
        return [
            10,
            25,
            50
        ];
    }
```

### Conditional limits specifying

You might want to choose the limits you are exposing depending on the user, you can achieve this by conditioning the `exposedLimits` method:

```php
public function exposedLimits(\Lomkit\Rest\Http\Requests\RestRequest $request)
{
    $exposedLimits = [
            10,
            25,
            50
        ];

    if ($request->user()->isAdministrator()) {
        array_push($exposedLimits, 1000);
    }

    return $exposedLimits;
}
